The primary tumor must be deemed resectable by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon certified or trained according to local standards and who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice.
Surgical resection of the primary NSCLC can occur by open thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and resection can be achieved by segmentectomy, lobectomy, sleeve resection, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.
Patients undergoing wedge resection are not eligible for this study.
Note: Patients undergoing segmentectomy must have tumors less than 2 cm in maximum diameter.
Where a resection has been extended by means of a wedge resection of an adjacent lobe to ensure complete resection of a tumor at or crossing a fissure between lobes, this is acceptable if surgical margins are clear of disease.
Where the resection of a second tumor nodule (eg, a T4 lesion) is undertaken by means of a wedge resection of a separate lobe, then the patient is not eligible. At a minimum, the following parameters should be met for a tumor to be declared completely resected: The surgeon performing the resection should remove all gross disease by the end of surgery.
All surgical margins of resection must be macroscopically negative for tumor. Pathology and/or operative reports must include the examination of at least 2 different mediastinal lymph node (N2) levels, one of which is the subcarinal node-group (level 7) and the second of which is lobe-specific (defined below). Note: In the uncommon clinical situation where the surgeon thoroughly examines a mediastinal lymph node level and does not find any lymph nodes, that mediastinal lymph node level may be counted among the minimum 2 required levels.
However, the surgeon must clearly document in the operative report or in a separate written statement that the lymph node level was explored and no lymph nodes were present.
Normal appearing lymph nodes, if present, must be biopsied or removed.
Exploration of nodes must clearly be documented in medical file if not recorded in operative report. Note: Lobe-specific lymph node stations are classified based on the location of the primary tumor as follows (based on IASLC 2009 lymph node map terminology [Rusch et al 2009]): Stations 2R and 4R for right upper lobe or middle lobe tumors, stations 4L, 5, and 6 for left upper lobe tumors, stations 8 and 9 for lower lobe tumors of both sides (Adachi et al 2017, Rami-Porta et al 2005). No extracapsular nodal extension of the tumor is observed in resected mediastinal N2 lymph nodes. Note: Extracapsular nodal extension in resected N1 nodes is permitted.

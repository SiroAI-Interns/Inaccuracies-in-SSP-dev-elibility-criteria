Participants are non-smokers or ex-smokers for more than 90 days prior to screening, or smoke no more than 5 cigarettes per day. If users of nicotine products (i.e., spray, patch, e-cigarette, etc.), they should use the equivalent of no more than 5 cigarettes per day. Participants must agree to abstain from smoking while in the unit; 13. Use of any prescription drugs, herbal supplements (e.g., St John's Wort) or over-the-counter medication within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the PfSPZ-DVI Challenge, or an anticipated requirement for the use of these during the course of the study (see Section 6.2); Note: If necessary, the incidental use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (2 g/day, 10 g/week) may be acceptable at the Investigator's discretion and will be documented in the eSource system. The use of nutritional supplements during this time that are not believed to have the potential to affect participant safety nor the overall results of the study, may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Investigator. 14. Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, bowel disease), distribution, metabolism or excretion; 15. Personnel (e.g., Investigator, sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator or anyone mentioned in the delegation log) directly involved in the conduct of the study; 16.

Use of systemic antibiotics with known antimalarial activity within 5 half-lives of PfSPZ-DVI Challenge (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones or azithromycin) or an anticipated requirement for the use of these during the study period (see Section 6.2); 23.

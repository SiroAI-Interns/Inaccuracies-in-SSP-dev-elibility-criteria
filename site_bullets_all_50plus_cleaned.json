The primary tumor must be deemed resectable by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon certified or trained according to local standards and who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice. Surgical resection of the primary NSCLC can occur by open thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and resection can be achieved by segmentectomy, lobectomy, sleeve resection, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. Patients undergoing wedge resection are not eligible for this study. Note: Patients undergoing segmentectomy must have tumors less than 2 cm in maximum diameter. Where a resection has been extended by means of a wedge resection of an adjacent lobe to ensure complete resection of a tumor at or crossing a fissure between lobes, this is acceptable if surgical margins are clear of disease. Where the resection of a second tumor nodule (eg, a T4 lesion) is undertaken by means of a wedge resection of a separate lobe, then the patient is not eligible. At a minimum, the following parameters should be met for a tumor to be declared completely resected: Note: Extracapsular nodal extension in resected N1 nodes is permitted. Note: The highest mediastinal node resected can be positive for malignancy. Note: Carcinoma-in-situ can be present at the bronchial margin.",
